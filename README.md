# swearilog
Swift verilog

## About

Note:

  - Not ready for public consumption

  - Very early, experimental, in flux

  - Doesn't do much of anything yet


My Goals:

  - Learn a bit about [Swift](https://swift.org/)

  - Perhaps port some parts of the [VL Verilog Toolkit](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____VL) from ACL2 to a more popular language



## Build

I'm doing this on a Linux machine (no xcode).  Build is just:

```
swift build
```

In the root directory.  This should create a `.build/debug/swearilog`
executable, but note that it doesn't do much of anything.
